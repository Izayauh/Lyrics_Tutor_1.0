Title: The Room Where It Happens
Artist: Lin-Manuel Miranda

Alexander Koptyaev:
T happened

And no one else was in the room where it happened

Alexander Hamilton!

What did they say to you to get you
To sell New York City down the river?

Alexander Hamilton!

Did Washington know about the dinner?
Was there Presidential pressure to deliver?

Alexander Hamilton!

Or did you know, even then, it doesn't matter
Where you put the U.S. Capital?

'Cause we'll have the banks
We're in the same spot

You got more than you gave

And I wanted what I got
When you got skin in the game, you stay in the game
But you don't get a win unless you play in the game
Oh, you get love for it
You get hate for it
You get nothing if you...

Wait for it, wait for it, wait!

God help and forgive me
I wanna build something that's gonna outlive me

What do you want, Burr? (What do you want, Burr?)
What do you want, Burr? (What do you want, Burr?)
If you stand for nothing (What do you want, Burr?)
Burr, then what do you fall for? (What do you want?)

I
I wanna be in the room where it happens
The room where it happens
I
Wanna be in the room where it happens
The room where it happens

I (I wanna be in the room where it happens)
Wanna be (The room where it happens)
In the room where it happens (The room where it happens)
I (I wanna be in the room where it happens)
I wanna be in the room... (The room where it happens)
Oh (The room where it happens)
Oh (I wanna be in the room where it happens)
I wanna be (Where it happens)
I wanna be (Where it happens)
I've got to be,
I've got to be (I wanna be in the room where it happens)
In that room (The room where it happens)
In that big ol' room (The room where it happens)

The art of the compromise

Hold your nose and close your eyes

We want our leaders to save the day

But we don't get a say in what they trade away

We dream of a brand new start

But we dream in the dark for the most part

Dark as a tomb where it happens

I've got to be in the room... (The room where it happens)
I've got to be...
(The room where it happens)
I've got to be...
(The room where it happens)
Oh, I've got to be in
The room where it happens... (The room where it happens)
I've got to be, I've gotta be (The room where it happens)
I've gotta be
In the room (I wanna be in the room where it happens)
Click-boom! (Click-boom!)
