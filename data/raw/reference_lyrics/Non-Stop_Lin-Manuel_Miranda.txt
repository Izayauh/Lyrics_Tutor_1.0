Title: Non-Stop
Artist: Lin-Manuel Miranda

After the war I went back to New York
A-after the war I went back to New York
I finished up my studies and I practiced law
I practiced law, Burr worked next door

Even though we started at the very same time
Alexander Hamilton began to climb
How to account for his rise to the top?
Man, the man is non-stop

Gentlemen of the jury, I'm curious, bear with me
Are you aware that we're making hist'ry?
This is the first murder trial of our brand-new nation
The liberty behind deliberation (Non-stop!)
I intend to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt
With my assistant counsel

Co-counsel
Hamilton, sit down
Our client Levi Weeks is innocent
Call your first witness
That's all you had to say

Okay
One more thing–

Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Soon that attitude may be your doom!

Why do you write like you're running out of time?
Write day and night like you're running out of time?
Every day you fight, like you're running out of time
Keep on fighting, in the meantime-
(Non-stop!)

Corruption's such an old song that we can sing
Along in harmony and nowhere is it stronger
Than in Albany
This colony's economy's increasingly stalling and
Honestly that's why he's just public service seems
To be calling me (Non-stop!)

I practiced the law, I practically perfected it
I've seen injustice in the world and I've corrected it
Now for a strong central democracy
If not, then I'll be Socrates
Throwing verbal rocks at these mediocrities

Hamilton, at the Constitutional Convention
I was chosen for the Constitutional Convention
There as a New York junior delegate
Now what I'm going to say may sound indelicate

Goes and proposes his own form of government (What?)
His own plan for a new form of government (What?)
Talks for six hours, the convention is listless
Bright young man
Yo, who the eff is this?

Why do you always say what you believe?
Why do you always say what you believe?
Every proclamation guarantees
Free ammunition for your enemies (Awww!)

Why do you write like it's going out of style? (Hey)
Write day and night like it's going out of style? (Hey)
Every day you fight like it's going out of style
Do what you do

Alexander?
Aaron Burr, sir
Well, it's the middle of the night
Can we confer, sir?
Is this a legal matter?
Yes, and it's important to me
What do you need?

Burr, you're a better lawyer than me
Okay
I know I talk too much, I'm abrasive
You're incredible in court
You're succinct, persuasive
My client needs a strong defense
You're the solution

Who's your client?
The new U.S. Constitution?
No
Hear me out
No way!
A series of essays, anonymously published
Defending the document to the public

No one will read it
I disagree
And if it fails?
Burr, that's why we need it
The constitution's a mess
So it needs amendments
It's full of contradictions
So is independence
We have to start somewhere
No, no way
You're making a mistake

Good night
Hey
What are you waiting for?
What do you stall for? (What?)
We won the war
What was it all for?
Do you support this constitution?
Of course
Then defend it

And what if you're backing the wrong horse?
Burr, we studied and we fought and we killed
For the notion of a nation we now get to build
For once in your life, take a stand with pride
I don't understand how you stand to the side

I'll keep all my plans close to my chest
(Wait for it, wait for it, wait)
I'll wait here and see which way the wind will blow
I'm taking my time, watching the afterbirth of a nation
Watching the tension grow
I am sailing off to London
I am accompanied by someone who always pays
I have found a wealthy husband who will
Keep me in comfort for all my days
He is not a lot of fun, but there's no one
Who can match you for turn of phrase
My Alexander
Angelica
Don't forget to write

Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you're alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough
And if your wife could share a fraction of your time
If I could grant you peace of mind
Would that be enough?

Alexander joins forces with James Madison
And John Jay to write a series of essays
Defending the new United States Constitution
Entitled The Federalist Papers
The plan was to write a total of 25 essays
The work divided evenly among the three men
In the end, they wrote 85 essays
In the span of six months
John Jay got sick after writing five
James Madison wrote 29
Hamilton wrote the other 51

How do you write like you're running out of time? (Running out of time?)
Write day and night like you're running out of time? (Running out of time?)
Every day you fight, like you're running out of time
Like you're running out of time
Are you running out of time? Awwww!

How do you write like tomorrow won't arrive?
How do you write like you need it to survive?
How do you write every second you're alive?
Every second you're alive? Every second you're alive?

They're asking me to lead
I am doing the best I can
To get the people that I need
I'm asking you to be my right-hand man (Treasury or State?)
I know it's a lot to ask (Treasury or State?)
To leave behind the world you know

Sir, do you want me to run the Treasury or State department?
Treasury
Let's go

Alexander
I have to leave
Alexander–
Look around, look around at how lucky we are to be alive right now
Helpless

They are asking me to lead
Look around, isn't this enough?
He never will be satisfied (What would be enough)
He will never be satisfied (To be satisfied)
Satisfied, satisfied

History has its eyes on you (Look around)
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room? (Non-stop)

Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room? (Non-stop)
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room? (History has its eyes)
Why do you fight like you're running out of time? (Non-stop)
Why do you fight like

History has its eyes on you
I am not throwin' away my shot (Just you wait)
I am not throwin' away my shot (Just you wait)
I am Alexander Hamilton
Hamilton, just you wait
I am not throwin' away my shot
