Title: Depression & Obsession
Artist: XXXTENTACION

Depression and obsession don't mix well
I'm poisoned, and my body don't feel well

I ate her, inside and out, I feel my stomach turnin'
Make out hill, where we met we let our lips do all the talkin'
And now I'm hooked and

Depression and obsession don't mix well (well)
Hollywood's motels, hell, I think I'm just obsessed with you
Depression and obsession don't mix well
Hollywood's motels, hell, I think I'm just obsessed with you
