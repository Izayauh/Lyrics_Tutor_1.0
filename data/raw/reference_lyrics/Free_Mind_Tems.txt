Title: Free Mind
Artist: Tems

Yeah, yeah my mind
Yeah, yeah my mind

I said, "Five in the morning"
I wake up to fight for my earnings
The fear in my mind is a warning
Praying to the one you rely in
I've been wandering all day
I try to be fine but I can't be
The noise in my mind wouldn't leave me
I try to get by but I'm burning

And behind my mind it runs
All these thoughts have troubled me
Fighting to give up my pain
Fighting to be on my lane
My mind running to the other side
When it's time to live my life
Then it tries to take me out
Tell you what I need right here

I really need, I really need timе now
I really need, I need a free mind now
I really need, I really need minе now
I really need, I need to free my mind now
I really need, I really need time now
I really need, I need a free mind now
I really need, I really need my mind now, oh yeah

This is the peace that you cannot buy
Send me a love that you cannot mix
One is the joy that you cannot waste
And the other one price that you cannot fix
This is the peace that you cannot buy
Finding a way when you cannot see
Man will desist if he cannot pray
I need to find release

But behind my mind it runs
All these thoughts have troubled me
Fighting to give up my pain
Fighting to be on my lane
My mind running to the other side
When it's time to live my life
Then it tries to take me out
Tell you what I need right here

I really need, I really need my mind now
I really need, I need a free mind now
I really need, I really need time now
I really need, I need to free my mind now
I really need, I really need time now
I really need, I need a free mind now
I really need, I really need time now, oh yeah

To set me free
Freer than the open mind
Farther than the eyes can handle
Freer than the ocean now yeah, yeah
So set me free
Now I need to find release
Set me to the open sky
Now I need to free my mind yeah, yeah

I might be falling deep
I might be falling deep
I might be falling deep
I might be falling deep

Tell me now what you need
I've been going to God
When I'm all in my mind
I might be falling deep

Falling deep

I might be falling
I might be falling
I might be falling
I might be falling, yeah
