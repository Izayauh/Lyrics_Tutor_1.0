Title: Somewhere Only We Know
Artist: Keane

I walked across an empty land
[00:30.37] I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
[00:35.83] I felt the earth beneath my feet
[00:41.38] Sat by the river, and it made me complete
[00:46.91] Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
[00:52.24] I'm getting old, and I need something to rely on
[00:57.92] So, tell me when you're gonna let me in
[01:03.21] I'm getting tired, and I need somewhere to begin
[01:09.06] I came across a fallen tree
[01:14.76] I felt the branches of it looking at me
[01:20.05] Is this the place we used to love?
[01:25.71] Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?
[01:31.17] Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
[01:36.72] I'm getting old, and I need something to rely on
[01:42.49] So tell me when you're gonna let me in
[01:47.83] I'm getting tired, and I need somewhere to begin
[01:53.72] And if you have a minute, why don't we go
[01:58.47] Talk about it somewhere only we know?
[02:05.69] This could be the end of everything
[02:09.90] So, why don't we go somewhere only we know?
[02:18.21] Somewhere only we know
[02:21.36] 
[02:27.42] Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
[02:32.62] I'm getting old, and I need something to rely on
[02:38.11] So, tell me when you're gonna let me in
[02:43.59] I'm getting tired, and I need somewhere to begin
[02:48.76] And if you have a minute, why don't we go
[02:55.46] Talk about it somewhere only we know?
[03:01.14] This could be the end of everything
[03:05.71] So, why don't we go?
[03:08.37] So, why don't we go?
[03:10.96] 
[03:18.11] Ooh, ah
[03:19.22] Oh
[03:21.22] 
[03:23.64] This could be the end of everything
[03:28.14] So, why don't we go somewhere only we know?
[03:33.93] 
[03:36.31] Somewhere only we know
[03:42.25] Somewhere only we know
[03:44.32]
