Title: Everything I've Ever Wanted
Artist: Tiffany Day

If this is everything I've ever wanted why does it feel,
like somethings missing god I question is this actually real?
I've never been able to see myself as somebody more
somebody like the other bodies on the screen i adore.
And If i got a little love from you is it just my luck?
Or do you actually believe I'm someone you could look up to?
Cause I never really saw it in me I don't believe
that you could see it in my either I think I'm a copy.
You see I'm terrified that i dont really know myself well.
I get too influenced and in over my head, I can't tell
what's really me or really you the lines are always a blur
I feel this pity deep inside me, I'm self conscious, it hurts.
So I'll keep living out my dreams of meeting people I love,
But I can't tell if they think I'm somebody worthy of trust.
I always dreamed about these moments now they're actually real.
But somehow I'm stuck in my head and I don't know how to feel.
I thought that maybe if I signed a piece of paper my life
Would be the way that I imagined everything would be right.
And now the paper's right in front of me, the pin in my hand.
But God, I'm terrified of it and I just don't understand.
How the passion for the thing that raised me up is a child
Turned into my greatest fear in how I don't even smile.
When something good comes crashing into me, it's like I can't breathe.
Because all I think about is when that good thing finally leaves.


if this is everything ive ever wanted
Every every ive ever wanted
Everything ive ever wanted why does it feel?
IF this is everything ive ever wanted
every every thing ive ever wanted
everything ive ever wanted why does it feel?
IF this is everything ive ever wanted
every every thing ive ever wanted
everything ive ever wanted why does it feel?
