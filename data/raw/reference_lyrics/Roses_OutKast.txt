See Caroline
All the guys would say she's mighty fine (mighty fine)
But mighty fine only got you somewhere half the time
And the other half either got you cussed out, or coming up short
Yeah, now dig this, now, even though (even though)
You'd need a golden calculator to divide (to divide)
The time it took to look inside and realize that
Real guys go for real down to Mars girls, ha yeah
I know you'd like to think your shit don't stink
But lean a little bit closer
See roses really smell like poo-poo-ooh
Yeah, roses really smell like poo-poo-ooh
I know you'd like to think your shit don't stink
But lean a little bit closer
See roses really smell like poo-poo-ooh
Yeah, roses really smell like poo-poo-ooh
Caroline (Caroline)
See, she's the reason for the word "bitch" (bitch)
I hope she's speeding on the way to the club
Trying to hurry up to get to a baller
Or singer or somebody like that
And try to put on her makeup in the mirror
And crash, crash, crash into a ditch (just playing)
She needs a golden calculator to divide (to divide)
The time it takes to look inside and realize
That real guys go for real down to Mars girls, yeah
I know you'd like to think your shit don't stink
But lean a little bit closer
See roses really smell like poo-poo-ooh
Yeah, roses really smell like poo-poo-ooh, yeah I
I know you'd like to think your shit don't stink
But lean a little bit closer
See roses really smell like poo-poo-ooh
Yeah, roses really smell like poo-poo-ooh
Aye, aye, yeah, yeah, yeah
Well she's got a hotty's body, but her attitude is potty
When I met her at a party she was hardly acting naughty
I said, "Shawty, would you call me?"
She said, "Pardon me, are you ballin'?"
I said, "Darling, you sound like a prostitute pausing"
Oh so you're one them freaks? Get geeked at the sight of an ATM receipt
But game, been peeped, dropping names she's weak
Trickin' off this bitch is lost
Must take me for a geek, ah, quick way to eat, ah
Neat place sleep, ah, rent-a-car for a week, ah, trick for a treat, no
Go, on the raw sex, my AIDS test is flawless
Regardless, we don't want to get involved without them lawyers
And judges, just to hold grudges in the courtroom
I want to see ya support bra not support you
I know you'd like to think your shit don't stink
But lean a little bit closer
See roses really smell like poo-poo-ooh
Yeah, roses really smell like poo-poo-ooh, yeah I
I know you'd like to think your shit don't stink
But lean a little bit closer
See roses really smell like poo-poo-ooh
Yeah, roses really smell like poo-poo-ooh, I, I, yeah
I know you'd like to think, (I know) your shit don't stink (stink but)
But lean a little bit closer (closer)
See roses really smell like poo-poo-ooh (smell like poo-ooh)
Yeah, roses really smell like poo-poo-ooh (like, ohh)
I know you'd like to think your shit don't stink (ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
But lean a little bit closer (yeah, eh-yeah)
See roses really smell like poo-poo-ooh
Yeah, roses really smell like poo-poo-ooh
Better come back down to Mars
Girl, quit chasin' cars
What happens when the dough gets low?
Bitch, you ain't that fine
No way, no way, no way
Better come back down to Mars
Girl, quit chasin' cars
What happens when the dough gets low?
Bitch, you ain't that fine
No way, no way, no way
Crazy bitch, crazy bitch, crazy bitch
Crazy bitch, crazy bitch, crazy bitch
Crazy bitch
Bitch (crazy bitch)
Stupid ass bitch (crazy bitch)
Ol' punk ass bitch (crazy bitch)
Ol' dumbass bitch (crazy bitch)
A bitch's bitch (crazy (bitch)
Just a bitch (crazy bitch)
Stupid ass bitch (crazy bitch)
Ol' punk ass bitch (crazy bitch)
Ol' dumbass bitch (crazy bitch)
A bitch's bitch (crazy (bitch)
Just a bitch
