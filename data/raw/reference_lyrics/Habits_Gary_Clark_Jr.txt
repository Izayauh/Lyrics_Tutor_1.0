Title: Habits
Artist: Gary Clark Jr.

I've got habits that I just can't break, mm
When I think about it, I start to shake
I've been feeling like this for a while
And I always hide behind my crooked smile
I keep running in circles, oh
Chasing my tail
I've lost my purpose, hmm
I need some help, oh
I've had good days, and I've had bad, hm
I wouldn't trade it for the time that we've had
White lies, oh, white lies
Bright smiles turn to crying eyes
And I keep running in circles, no
Chasing my tail
It looks good on the surface, hmm
I need some help
'Cause we've only got one shot from the moment we started
Gotta stay on lock, locked on target
I got everything I need, more than I wanted
But it means nothing when you're gone, gone
But it means nothing when you're gone, gone
I know nothing is for sure
I know nothing is for sure, I
I know nothing is for sure, oh
I know nothing is for sure
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
I've got habits that I just can't break
Come back, my love (come back, my love)
Come back, my love

Come back, my love, love (come back, my love)
Come back, my love
Come back, my love
Come back, my love (come back, my love)
Come back, my love
Come back, my love

Come back, my love
Come back, my love, love (come back, my love)
Come back, my love
Come back, my love
Come back, my love (come back, my love)
Come back, my love
Come back, my love
Come back, my love, love (come back, my love)
Come back, my love
Come back, my love
Come back, my love (come back, my love)
Come back, my love
Come back, my love
Come back, my love, love (come back, my love)
Come back, my love
