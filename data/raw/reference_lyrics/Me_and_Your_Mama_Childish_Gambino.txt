Title: Me and Your Mama
Artist: Childish Gambino

I'm in love when we are smokin' that la-la-la-la-la
I'm in love when we are smokin' that la-la-la-la-la
I'm in love when we are smokin' that la-la-la-la-la
I'm in love when we are smokin' that la-la-la-la-la
I'm in love when we are smokin' that la-la-la-la-la
I'm in love when we are smokin' that la-la-la-la-la
I'm in love when we are smokin' that la-la-la-la-la
I'm in love when we are smokin' that la-la-la-la-la

Do what you want
I'm telling you
Let me into your heart

Can't stand it, backhanded
They wanna see us fallin' apart
You know that I love you
So let me into your heart

Let me into your heart
Do you really love me?
I'm gon' get you, girl, ahh

This is the end of us
Sleeping with the moon and the stars
I know where you've been
You can see the sun far from near

Let me into your heart
Oh, this ain't no bullshit
I really love you, girl
Oh, oh, God

Girl, you really got a hold on me
So this isn't just puppy love
Girl, you really got a hold on me
So this isn't just puppy love

I'm in love when we are smokin' that
Oh my God, I
Let me in
Girl, you really got a hold, woo!
