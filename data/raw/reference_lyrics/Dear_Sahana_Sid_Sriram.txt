Title: Dear Sahana
Artist: Sid Sriram

Just as quiet as dawn
You crept up on me
I felt strangely in love
Frail heart still there
Terrified of the way you make me feel
Won't you let me in?

Eyes weary
Full of life
For you, I'd put my fears aside
Just as quiet as dawn (Oh)
You left in the early morning
I'm back again
Won't you let me in?

Found your number, don't know if I should call (Dear Sahana)
All the different ways you make me feel
Could be the distance, made this love visible (Dear Sahana)
All the different ways you make me feel

There are some times
We fall from grace
Searching for infinite alone
And oh, how I try (I try)
To go on my own (On my own)
Every path seems to lead me back to you
You

Yeah-yeah, oh
Found your number, don't know if I should call (Dear Sahana)
All the different ways you make me feel
Could be the distance, made this love visible (Dear Sahana)
All the different ways you make me feel
(Dear Sahana)
All the different ways you make me feel (Oh, you know I've been thinking about you)
Could be the distance, made this love visible (Dear Sahana)
You make me feel

Oh-oh, oh me
Ooh, different ways I've been feeling about you, uh
Dear Sahana
Different ways I've been feeling 'bout you
Dear Sahana, ooh, girl
Dear Sahana, oh
I've been thinking 'bout you, girl (Girl)
Dear Sahana, you know I need you
Oh, I don't want you, but I need you
I don't just want you, oh, I need you
