Title: Beautiful
Artist: Yana

Crying on a Thursday
And you're driving back to my place
And it's hurting, but it's okay
Cause I won't say a thing to you
And you won't ask how I'm doing
Cause you know that I've been crying
On my own time
Baby, it's a fine line

It's got nothing to do with you
Nothing to do with you
You're doing everything well
Everything's beautiful
Everything you do has
Nothing to do with me
Nothing to do with me
But I pretend anyways
Cause all of it's beautiful

Maybe it's the drinking
Or maybe it's been boring
But I'm trying to ignore it
Cause you're my everything
And now it's a collision
Between your habits
And my feelings
And I'm feeling like a loser
I'm dreading my future

It's got nothing to do with you
Nothing to do with you
You're doing everything well
Everything's beautiful
Mmm, everything you do has
Nothing to do with me
Nothing to do with me
But I pretend anyways
Cause all of it's beautiful

I can't escape
The mess I've made
It's an honest mistake
Oh, and I'm so naive
To think you'd love me
After you've seen my face

Got nothing to do with you
Nothing to do with you
You're doing everything well
Everything's beautiful
Mmm, everything you do has
Nothing to do with me
Nothing to do with me
But I pretend anyways
Cause all of it's beautiful, mmm
Mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm
