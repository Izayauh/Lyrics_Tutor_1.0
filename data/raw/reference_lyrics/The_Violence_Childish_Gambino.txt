Title: The Violence
Artist: Childish Gambino

Little girl, 13
Broke down, the violence (violence, violence)
(Violence, violence)
Little boys playin' 'round
Shot down, the violence (violence, violence)
The violence (violence, violence)
Baby girl, baby daddy
He's had it, the violence, the violence
The violence, the violence
Cut him up, in the gang
Did the same, the violence
The violence, oh

Don't worry 'bout tomorrow
The violence, the violence
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow
The violence, the violence

Beat him up, keep him down
Light him up, the violence (violence, violence)
Never say what you see
Keep quiet, the silence (silence, silence)
The silence (violence, violence)

Little boy, baby girl
Are you scared of the world?
Is it hard to live?
Just take care of your soul
Let the beauty unfold
You'll get through it

Don't worry 'bout tomorrow
The violence (the violence), the violence (the violence)
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow
The violence (the violence), the violence (the violence)
What do you love?
I love, who do I love?
Yeah, who do you love? Me?
Yeah
Anybody else?
Mom and Oiallo and Genesis
And I love, and I love Roland
And I love myself
That's, those are good answers
Those are really good answers
Do you love yourself?
I do love myself
Does mommy love herself?
Absolutely
Mom
Do you love yourself?
Yeah, I do
You best or- (do both)
