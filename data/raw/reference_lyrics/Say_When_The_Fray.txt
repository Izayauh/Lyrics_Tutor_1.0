Title: Say When
Artist: The Fray

See you there
Don't know where you come from
Unaware the stare from someone
Don't appear to care that I saw you, and I want you too
What's your name? Because I have to know it
You let me in and begin to show it
We're terrified, because we're heading straight for it, might get it
Your favorite song plays on the background
All alone but you turn it up now
And everyone is rising to meet you, to greet you
Turn around and you're walking toward me
I'm breaking down and you're breathing slowly
Say the word and I will be your man, your man
Say when
And my own two hands will comfort you
Tonight, tonight
Say when
And my own two arms will carry you
Tonight, tonight
Come close and even closer
We bring it in, but we go no further
We separate two ghosts in one mirror, no mirror
Later on, if it turns to chaos
Hurricanes coming all around us
See the crack, pull it back
From the window, you stay low
Say when
And my own two hands will comfort you
Tonight, tonight
Say when
And my own two arms will carry you
Tonight, tonight
Come across, you're lost and broken
You're coming to, you're slow and waking
You start to shake
Still haven't spoken, what happened?
I'm coming back and you just don't know when
You want to cry but there's nothing coming
They're gonna push until you give in, say when
Now we're here and it turns to chaos
Hurricanes coming all around us
Another crack throws you back from the window
You stay low
All began with the man of country
Another plan sends another century
Around again another nation, fallen
Any guy can be on both sides of a coin
Never understood why
Some of us never get a shoulder, shoulder
Some of this we kept with us
All of us will go out there
'Cause it never stops until we give in, give in
To give in, give in
Say when
And my own two hands will comfort you
Tonight, tonight
Say when
And my own two arms will carry you
Tonight, tonight
Say when
And my own two hands will comfort you
Tonight, tonight.
