Title: Wash
Artist: Jon Bellion

Let it wash over me

Treat your body like a river and (let it wash over me)
See you coming at me like a wave and (let it wash over me)
Touch me 12 ways, stars on the lake look like a million diamonds
Let it wash all over me

Treat your body like a river and (let it wash over me)
See you coming at me like a wave and (let it wash over me)
Touch me 12 ways, stars on the lake look like a million diamonds
Let it wash all over me

Left eye waterfall, you see me from a third eye point of view
Oasis in my arms, my wonder wall
You fit me, fit me right, you fit me, fit me right
I, I, I, I

I don't need a star, your face is like a full-blown universe
I'm always gonna dive in where you are
You fit me, fit me right, you fit me, fit me right
I, I, I, I

Lay your grace on me
Hallelu-, you amaze me
When she walks away
That's my baby (sheesh)

Treat your body like a river and (let it wash over me)
See you coming at me like a wave and (let it wash over me)
Touch me 12 ways, stars on the lake look like a million diamonds
Let it wash all over me

Treat your body like a river and (let it wash over me)
See you coming at me like a wave and (let it wash over me)
Touch me 12 ways, stars on the lake look like a million diamonds
Let it wash all over me

Let it wash, let it wash all over me
Let it wash, let it wash all over me

Left eye waterfall
You see me from a third eye point of view
Oasis in my arms
Let it wash, let it wash all over me

Treat your body like a river and (let it wash over me)
See you coming at me like a wave and (let it wash over me)
Touch me 12 ways, stars on the lake look like a million diamonds
Let it wash all over me

Treat your body like a river and (let it wash over me)
See you coming at me like a wave and (let it wash over me)
Touch me 12 ways, stars on the lake look like a million diamonds
Let it wash all over me

Yeah
Let it wash, let it wash all over me
Yeah, oh yeah, oh
Let it wash all over me

Left eye waterfall, you see me from a third eye point of view
Oasis in my arms, my wonder wall
You fit me, fit me, fit me...
