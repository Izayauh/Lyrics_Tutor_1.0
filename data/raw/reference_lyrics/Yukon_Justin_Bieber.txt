Title: Yukon
Artist: Justin Bieber

In the city, uh, 'member you used to drive a Yukon, I'd pick up whenever you called
In the parkin' lot in Tucson, like, "Uh, are you with me?"
In the Phantom with the roof gone, I pull up like Jimmy Neutron
I can help you get a move on, like U-Haul, oh, and I know

Uh, you like to go slow, but we could go faster, tell me the password
Slide city, slide city, you know what that means, uh
I'm comin' up on you quickly, mm, I'll bring nice things, mm
Slide city, slide, plenty other men tryna get in the bed
So when it gets lost and sick, I know it's gon' make you beg

What would I do (what would I do?), if I didn't love you, babe?
What would I do if I didn't lock you, babe?
What would I do (what would I do?), if I didn't love you?
Mm (yeah), mm

Just wanna be the one to give you what you want
I could put you in the Yves Saint Laurent
Ridin' around town with your hair down, uh (true)
I know you like it when I tell you what you want
Give you back what you done and what you want
I can tell your friends if you don't want them, uh, uh, uh

Uh, you like to go slow, but we could go faster, tell me the password (uh)
Slide city, slide city, you know what that means, uh
I'm comin' up on you quickly, mm, I'll bring nice things (yeah, baby, I'll bring)
Slide city, slide, plenty other men tryna get in the bed
So when it gets lost and sick, I know it's gon' make you beg

What would I do, uh, if I didn't love you, babe?
What would I do if I didn't lock you, babe?
What would I do (what would I do?), if I didn't love you?
(What would I, what would I do?)

Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
